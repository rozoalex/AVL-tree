# AVL-tree
This java class implements an avl tree.
Each node is a binary search tree.
Each one has a key, which is a string, and a data, which is a java object.
The test tree class inserts data to a empty avl tree and delete some, print the tree with inoder and preoder and levelorder

the hashtable implements with the avl tree
the hash function multiply one and add one chars in the given string 
so that strings with the same chars but different order will have different index
the data gathers in the first 25%  so, the if the index is in the first 25%, the index will be add the square of the first char in the string
trying adding an existing key will give a exception
